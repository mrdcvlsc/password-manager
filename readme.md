# password-manager

A simple web application for managing and storing password, the **frontend** was created using vanila html, css, and javascript, it support mobile and desktop view, then the **backend** uses nodejs and fastify web framework.

Since this is a password-manager application where you can store sensitive information, I (the author) **do not claim** that it is a secure & foolproof application, there might be some vulnerabilities that I have missed when implementing this application, I created this project with the intent to learn frontend and backend web development only (_not to make a production grade application_), USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

**Demo**

Here is a demo of the web-app deployed in heroku. [See Demo](https://password-manager-demo-app.herokuapp.com/).
